                            You will be given 3 types of tasks to complete during this experimental evaluation.
                            Each task has specific instructions on what is expected of you.
                            Please aim to complete each <b>quickly and accurately</b> and press the "submit" button once you are done.
                            Please read these carefully and clear up any questions you have with your instructor <b>before</b> you begin the task.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Align on Rectangle Task</h4>
                        <p>
                            This task requires you to line up each letter/number on the black rectangle in the center of the screen.
                            Your goal is that each letter/number object lies perfectly on the rectangle.
                            Orientation on the rectangle doesn't matter.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Dodecahedron Tasks</h4>
                        <p>
                            A dodecahedron is a 10 sided shape, where each face is a pentagon.
                            This task has a dodecahedron in the center of the screen.
                            The dodecahedron has "cutouts" that correspond to 3 different numbers/letters.
                            As you can see in the image below, there is a purple dodecahedron, with a grey cut-out 9.
                            This corresponds to the pink 9 on the top left.
                            All 3 of the numbers/letters corresponding to the cut-outs are visible in your scene.
                            This task requires you to slot each letter/number into the dodecahedron.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Arrange Scene Tasks</h4>
                        <p>
                            These tasks have 2 sub-tasks.
                            <br>
                            First, you must place the table onto the tiled floor so that it is centered on the highlighted rectangle.
                            <br>
                            Second, you are required to place the lamp onto the table in the center of highlighted circle.
                            Ensure that both the table, floor and lamp all have the same rotation.
                        </p>
